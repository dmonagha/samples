# Sample Subnet Problem

Implement a script that determines if a given IPv4 address in a given subnet

The IP address is passed as a string representation of a 32-bit unsigned int (e.g., 0x62D2ED4B)
The subnet is passed as a string representation of a CIDR subnet (e.g., "98.210.237.192/26")
Output True if the IPv4 address is in the subnet.


```
ipaddr.py -i inputfile -o outputfile
```
